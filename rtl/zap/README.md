## 1. Introduction

The ZAP is intended to be used in FPGA projects that need a high performance application class soft processor core. Most aspects of the processor can be configured through HDL parameters.  The processor can reach clock speeds of up to 145MHz on Artix-7/Spartan-7 series devices.

The default processor specification is as follows (based on default parameters):

| **Property**               | **Value**                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

A simplified block diagram of the ZAP pipeline is shown below. Note that ZAP is mostly a single issue scalar processor.

![Pipeline](Pipeline.drawio.svg)

ZAP includes several microarchitectural enhancements to improve instruction throughput, hide external bus and memory latency and boost performance:

* The ability to continue instruction execution even when the data cache is being filled. The data cache features hit under miss capability. The processor stalls when an instruction that depends on the cache access is decoded.
* Direct mapped instruction and data caches. These caches are virtually indexed and virtually tagged. Individual caches allow code and data to be accessed at the same time. The sizes of these caches can be set during synthesis. Cache size is parameterizable. Cache line width may be set as well.
* The D-cache also stores the physical address of the cache line on write as this allows subsequent cache clean operations to avoid having to walk the page table again. This feature does increase resource usage but can significantly reduce cache clean latency.
* Direct mapped instruction and data memory TLBs. Having separate translation buffers allows data and code translation to happen in parallel. The sizes of these TLBs can be set during synthesis. Six different TLB memories are provides, each providing direct mapped buffering for sections, large page and small page, each for instruction and data (3 x 2 = 6). The sizes of these 6 memories is parameterizable.
* A parameterizable store buffer that helps buffer stores when the cache is disabled or if the data access is uncacheable. When the cache is enabled and data is cacheable, the store buffer helps buffer cache clean operations. This is slightly different from a write buffer.
* A 4-state bimodal branch predictor that predicts the outcome of immediate branches and branch-and-link instructions. ZAP employs a BTB (Branch Target Buffer) to predict branch outcomes early.
* A 4 deep return address stack that stores the predicted return address of branch and link instructions function return. When a `BX LR`, `MOV PC,LR` or a block load with PC in register list, the processor pops off the return address. Note that switching between A (32-bit) and T state (16-bit) has a penalty of 12 cycles.
* The ability to execute most 32-bit instructions in a single clock cycle. The only instructions that take multiple cycles include branch-and-link, 64-bit loads and stores, block loads and stores, swap instructions and `BLX/BLX2`.
* A highly efficient superpipeline with dual feedback networks to minimize pipeline stalls as much as possible while allowing for high clock frequencies. A deep 17 stage superpipelined architecture that allows the CPU to run at relatively high FPGA speeds.
* Support for single cycle saturating additions and subtractions with the result being available for immediate use in the next instruction itself.
  * **NOTE:** Multiplication/MAC operations takes 3 cycles per operation (+1 is result is immediately used). Note that the multiplier inside the ZAP processor is not pipelined.
* The abort model is base restored. This allows for the implementation of a demand based paging system if supporting software is available.

### 1.1. Superpipelined Microarchitecture

ZAP uses a 17 stage execution pipeline to increase the speed of the flow of instructions to the processor. The 17 stage pipeline consists of Address Generator, TLB Check, Cache Access, Memory, Fetch, Instruction Buffer, T Decoder, Pre-Decoder, Decoder, Issue, Shift, Execute, TLB Check, Cache Access, Memory and Writeback.

> To maintain compatibility with the V5TE standard, reading the program counter (PC) will return PC + 8 when read.

During normal operation:

* One instruction is writing out one or two results to the register bank.
  * In case of `LDR`/`STR` with writeback, two results are being written to the register bank in a single cycle.
  * All other instructions write out one result to the register bank per cycle.
  * A pending load might write another value. The RF has 3 write ports.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is performing arithmetic, logic or memory address generation operations. This stage also confirms or rejects the branch predictor's decisions. The ALU performs saturation in the same cycle.
* The instruction before that is performing a correction, shift or multiply/MAC operation.
* The instruction before that is performing a register or pipeline read.
* The instruction before that is being decoded.
* The instruction before that is being sequenced to micro-ops (possibly).
  * Most of the time, 1 x 32-bit instruction = 1 micro-op.
  * The only 32-bit instructions requiring more than 1 micro-op generation are `BLX, BL, LDM, STM, SWAP, LDRD, STRD, LDR loading to PC` and long multiply variants (They generate a 32-bit result per micro-op).
  * All other instructions are decode to just a single micro-op.
  * Most micro-ops can be execute in a single cycle.
  * This stage also causes branches predicted as taken to be actually executed. The latency for a successfully predicted taken branch is 3 cycles.
* The instruction before that is being being decompressed. This is only required in the T state, else the stage simply passes the instructions on.
* The instruction before that is popped off the instruction buffer.
* The instruction before that is pushed onto the instruction buffer. Branches\
  are predicted using a bimodal predictor (if applicable).
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.

The deep pipeline, although uses more resources, allows the ZAP to run at high clock speeds.

#### 1.1.1. Automatic Dual Forwarding Network

The ZAP pipeline has an efficient automatic dual forwarding network with interlock detection hardware. This is done automatically and no software intervention is required. This complex feedback logic guarantees that almost all micro-ops/instructions execute at a rate of 1 every cycle.

Most of the time, the pipeline is able to process 1 instruction per clock cycle. The only times a pipeline stalls (bubbles inserted) is when (assume 100% cache hit rate and 100% branch prediction rate):

* An instruction uses a register that is a data (not pointer) destination for an `LDR`/`LDM` instruction within 7 cycles.
* Two back to back instructions that require non-zero shift and the second instruction's operand overlaps with the first instruction's destination.
* When a previous instruction modifies the flags and the current instruction requires a non-trivial shift operation. Note that `LSL #0` is considered a trivial shift operation.
* The pipeline is executing any multiply/MAC instruction:
  * Introduces a 3 cycle bubble into the pipeline if a single register is written out. (+1 if two registers are written out)
  * An instruction that uses a register that is/are destination(s) for multiply/MAC adds +1 to the multiply/MAC operation's latency.
* `B` is executed as it adds a 3 cycle bubble due to branch prediction. Takes +1 cycle if link bit is set.
* `MOV`/`ADD` instructions with `pc/r15` as destination are executed. They will insert a 3 cycle bubble in the pipeline.
* `MSR` when writing to CPSR. This will insert a 12 cycle bubble into the pipeline.
* `LDx` with `pc/r15` in the register list/data register is executed. This will insert a 9 cycle bubble in the pipeline.
* `MCR`/`MRC` / `SWI` are executed. These will insert an 18 cycle bubble into the pipeline.

This snippet of 32-bit instruction code takes 6 cycles to execute:

```
    ADD  R1, R2, R2 LSL #10 (1 cycle)
    ADD  R1, R1, R1 LSL #20 (2 cycles)
    ADD  R3, R4, R5, LSR #3 (1 cycle)
    QADD R3, R3, R3         (1 cycle)
    MOV  R4, R3             (1 cycle)
```

This snippet of 32-bit instruction code takes only 5 cycles (Possible because of dual feedback network):

```
    ADD  R1, R2, R2, R2     (1 cycle)
    ADD  R1, R1, R1 LSL #2  (1 cycle)
    ADD  R3, R4, R5 LSR #3  (1 cycle)
    QADD R3, R3, R3         (1 cycle)
    MOV  R4, R3             (1 cycle)
```

#### 1.1.2. Single Cycle Load with Writeback

The ZAP can execute `LDR`/`STR` with writeback in a single cycle. It will perform a parallel write to the register file with the pointer register and the data register in the same cycle.

#### 1.1.3. Hit Under Miss/Execute Under Miss

Data cache accesses that are performing line fills will not block subsequent instructions from executing. In addition, the data cache supports hit under miss functionality i.e., the cache can service the next memory access (hit) while handing the current line fill (miss). Thus, the ZAP can change the order of completion of memory accesses with respect to other instructions, when possible, in a relatively simple way.

If a store misses and is in the process of a line fill, a subsequent load at the same address will report as a hit during the line fill.

Some examples are shown below.

The unoptimized code below takes 15 cycles due to improperly optimized load latency (The code still works fine):

```
LDR R1, [R2]
// Load latency since value is used immediately = 7 cycles
ADD R3, R2, R1 
ADD R4, R4, R5
ADD R5, R8, R7
ADD R12, R4, R5
ADD R13, R8, R7
ADD R11, R4, R5
ADD R10, R8, R7
ADD R10, R10, R11
```

This can be reduced to 9 cycles by reordering the code:

```
LDR R1, [R2]
// Load latency is hidden.
ADD R4, R4, R5
ADD R5, R8, R7
ADD R12, R4, R5
ADD R13, R8, R7
ADD R11, R4, R5
ADD R10, R8, R7
ADD R10, R10, R11
ADD R3, R2, R1 
```

#### 1.1.4. Multi Port Register File

ZAP implements the register file in flip-flops. The register file provides 4 read ports and 3 write ports (A, B and C). The operation is as follows:

| Operation           | Port A | Port B | Port C                               |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Load with Writeback | Used   | Used   | _Free to be used by background load_ |
| Other               | Used   | Unused | _Free to be used by background load_ |

#### 1.1.5. Branch Predictor and Return Address Stack

To improve performance, the ZAP processor uses a bimodal branch predictor. A branch memory is maintained which stores the state of each branch and the target address and branch tag. Note that the predictor can only predict the listed 32-bit instructions (and equivalent 16-bit instructions in T state):

`Bcc[L]`

`BX LR` that does not switch 32/16-bit instruction state.

`ADD`/`MOV` instruction with destination as PC.

`LDM` with PC in register list

`LDR` that loads to PC.

`MOV PC, LR`

instructions. Some of these utilize the RAS for better prediction. Using an unlisted instruction to branch will result in 12 cycles of penalty.

The processor implements a 4 deep return address stack. The RAS and the predictor cannot be disabled. They are transparent to software and self clearing if they predict a non branch instruction as a branch.

Upon calls to

* `BL offset`

the potential return address is pushed to a stack in the processor.

On encountering these 32-bit instructions (or equivalent 16-bit instructions):

* `BX LR`,
* `MOV PC, LR`
* `LDM` with PC in register list.
* `LDR` to PC with SP as base address register.

the CPU treats them as function returns and will pop return address of the stack much earlier.

This results in some performance improvement and reduced branch latency. Correctly predicted return takes 2 cycles (first two in the above list) or 9 cycles(last two in the above list), while incorrectly or unpredicted returns takes 12 cycles.

Returns that result in change from 32 to 16-bit instruction state or vice versa are unpredicted, and take 12 cycles. Performance optimization of returns is available only when no instruction set state change occurs i.e., for faster returns: 32-bit instruction code should return to 32-bit instruction code, 16-bit instruction code should return to 16-bit instruction code.

### 1.2. Wishbone Bus Interface

ZAP features a common 32-bit Wishbone B3 bus to access external resources (like DRAM/SRAM/IO etc). The processor can generate byte, halfword or word accesses. The processor uses CTI and BTE for efficient bus transfers. Note that multiprocessing is not readily supported and hence, `SWAP/SWAPB` instructions do not **actually** perform locked transfers.

The 32-bit standard Wishbone bus makes it easy to interface to other components over a typical 32-bit FPGA SoC bus, without the need for up/down converters.

#### 1.2.1. ONLY_CORE = 0x0 Configuration

In this configuration, the CPU is synthesized with cache and MMU. Use this mode for high performance. The performance benefits especially come from the cache, which provides a very low latency, high speed access path. Split caches allow code and data fetches to be paralleled. 

It is recommended to use WB registered feedback cycles. However, ZAP supports non registered feedback cycles in this mode too, but it is not recommended to use.

**The bus interface is efficient for burst transfers and hence, cache and MMU must be enabled as soon as possible for good performance. ZAP will issue burst transfers only if the cache is enabled.**

The diagram below shows 16 x 4 byte = 64 bytes of memory being fetched for a cache linefill. Note that the full bandwidth of the bus is utilized by using an efficient burst type transfer. With cache enabled, the processor is able to communicate with the memory at a peak rate of 568MB/s when running at 142MHz clock.

![](mem_read_burst.png)

The diagram below shows 16 x 4 byte = 64 bytes of cache (1 cacheline) being written back to memory. Note that the full bandwidth of the bus is utilized by using an efficient burst type transfer. With cache enabled, the processor is able to communicate with the memory at a peak rate of 568MB/s when running at 142MHz clock.

![](mem_write_burst.png)

Accesses to uncacheable locations are done using Wishbone classic cycles. These cycles are also used when the cache is disabled. The processor can issue a non-cacheable Wishbone access once every 5 cycles. With cache disabled, the processor is only able to communicate at a peak rate of 113.6MB/s when running at 142MHz clock.

<img title="" src="peripheral_access.png" alt="" width="679">

The table below summarizes the bus bandwidth utilization in this configuration.  The table below assumes WB registered feedback cycles, when accessing the bus.

| Access Type      | Parameter                                             | Value    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Cacheable Region | Instruction Fetch Rate (I$ Hit)                       | 568 MB/s |
| Cacheable Region | Data Access Rate (D$ Hit)                             | 568 MB/s |
| IO Region        | Instruction Fetch Rate (Interleaved with data access) | 28 MB/s  |
| IO Region        | Data Read Rate (Interleaved with instruction access)  | 28 MB/s  |
| IO Region        | Data Write Rate (Interleaved with instruction access) | 28 MB/s  |

#### 1.2.2. ONLY_CORE=0x1 Configuration

In this configuration, the CPU is synthesized without a cache and MMU. This mode exclusively generates BLOCK cycles. They typically require registered feedback cycles. However, ZAP supports non registered feedback cycles in this mode too, but it is not recommended to use. The table below assumes registered feedback cycles, as it would be the  most likely case in this scenario.

This configuration gives lower performance because:

- The WB bus may have high latency. And it's impact is magnified since every access needs to go to the bus.

- Contention between data and instruction fetches eats away throughput.

- Registered feedback cycles are required for BLOCK transfers (See Wishbone specification). 
  
  - This is because the bus cannot prepare ahead of time for the next address, as per definition of BLOCK transfer.
  
  - This further reduces throughput on the bus.

| Access Type | Parameter                                             | Value    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| IO Region   | Instruction Fetch Rate (Interleaved with data access) | 117 MB/s |
| IO Region   | Data Read Rate (Interleaved with instruction access)  | 117 MB/s |
| IO Region   | Data Write Rate (Interleaved with instruction access) | 117 MB/s |

### 1.3. System Control

Please refer to ref \[1] for CP15 CSR architectural requirements. The ZAP implements the following software accessible registers within its CP15 coprocessor.

NOTE: Cleaning and flushing cache and TLB is only supported for the entire memory.

Selective flushing of TLB will result in the entire TLB being flushed.

Selective cleaning of TLB will result in the entire TLB being cleaned.

The above rules are permitted as per the architecture spec \[1].

* Register 1: Cache and MMU control.

* Register 2: Translation Base.

* Register 3: Domain Access Control.

* Register 5: FSR.

* Register 6: FAR.

* Register 8: TLB functions.

* Register 7: Cache functions.
  
  * The arch spec allows for a subset of the functions to be implemented for register 7.
  
  * These below are valid value supported in ZAP for register 7. Using other operations will result in UNDEFINED operation.
    
    | Cache Operation                                      | Opcode2 | CRM    |
    | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
    | Flush instruction and data cache                     | 0b000   | 0b0111 |

* Register 13: FCSE Register.

### 1.4. Implementation Options

ZAP implements the integer instruction set specified in \[1]. T refers to the 16-bit instruction set and E refers to the enhanced DSP extensions. ZAP does not implement the optional floating point extension specified in Part C of \[1].

#### 1.4.1. Big and Little Endian

ZAP supports little endian byte ordering or BE-32 big endian byte ordering. The endianness is fixed by a parameter. The appropriate bit in CP15 that indicates endianness is read-only, and reflects the parameter set during synthesis.

#### 1.4.2. 26-Bit Architecture

ZAP does not support the legacy 26-bit mode.

#### 1.4.3. 16-bit Compressed Support

ZAP has support for the 16-bit V5T compressed instruction set.

#### 1.4.4. DSP Enhanced Instruction Set

The ZAP implements the DSP-enhanced instruction set (V5E). There are new multiply instructions that operate on 16-bit data values and new saturation instructions. Some of the new instructions are:

* `SMLAxy` 32<=16x16+32
* `SMLAWy` 32<=32x16+32
* `SMLALxy` 64<=16x16+64
* `SMULxy` 32<=16x16
* `SMULWy` 32<=32x16
* `QADD` adds two registers and saturates the result if an overflow occurred.
* `QDADD` doubles and saturates one of the input registers then add and saturate.
* `QSUB` subtracts two registers and saturates the result if an overflow occurred.
* `QDSUB` doubles and saturates one of the input registers then subtract and saturate.

**NOTE:** All of the multiplication and MAC operations in ZAP take a fixed 3 clock cycles (irrespective of 32x32=32, 32x32=64, 16x16+32 etc). Additional latency of 1 cycle is incurred if the result is required in the immediate next instruction. A further additional latency of 1 cycle is incurred if two registers must be updated (long multiply/MAC operations).

The ZAP also implements `LDRD`, `STRD` and `PLD` instructions with the following implementation notes:

* `PLD` is interpreted as a `NOP`.
* `MCRR` and `MRRC` are not intended to be used on coprocessor 15 (see \[1]). Since ZAP does not have an external coprocessor bus, these instructions should not be used.

#### 1.4.5. Base Register Update

If a data abort is signaled on a memory instruction that specifies writeback, the contents of the base register will not be updated. This holds for all load and store instructions. This behavior is referred to in the V5TE architecture \[1] as the Base Restored Abort Model.

#### 1.4.6. Cache and TLB Lockdown

ZAP does not support lockdown of cache and TLB entries.

#### 1.4.7. TLB Flush

ZAP implements global TLB flushing. If software tries to invalidate selective TLB entries, the entire TLB will be invalidated. This behavior is acceptable as per the architecture specification.

#### 1.4.8. Cache Clean and Flush

ZAP implements global cache cleaning and flushing. Cleaning and/or flushing specific cache lines/VA is not supported.

#### 1.4.9. Cache and TLB Structure

ZAP implements a direct mapped cache and TLB. Separate caches and TLBs exist for instruction and data paths. Each MMU (I and D) has 4 TLBs, one each for sections, large pages, small pages and tiny pages. Each one is direct mapped.

Thus, each cache uses 2 block RAMs (Tag and Data) and each MMU uses 4 RAMs. Functionally, the processor's memory subsystem requires 12 block RAMs. In practice, FPGA synthesis implements this using groups of smaller block RAMs (same overall function) so the BRAM count would be higher.

#### 1.4.10. FCSE

ZAP implements the FCSE.

#### 1.4.11. Cache/MMU Enabling

ZAP allows the cache and MMU to have these combinations:

| MMU | Cache | Behavior                                                   |
| --- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ON  | OFF   | All pages are treated as uncacheable. C bit is IGNORED.    |
| ON  | ON    | **Caching and paging enabled. Recommended configuration.** |
| OFF | OFF   | VA = PA. All addresses are treated as uncacheable.         |
| OFF | ON    | INVALID CONFIGURATION.                                     |

#### 1.4.12. Coprocessor Interface

ZAP internally implements an internal CP15 coprocessor using its internal bus mechanism. The coprocessor interface is internal to the ZAP processor and is not exposed. Thus, ZAP only has access to its internal coprocessor 15. External coprocessors cannot be attached to the processor.

## 2. System Integration

### 2.1. Parameters

Note that all parameters should be 2^n. Cache size should be multiple of line size and at least 16 x line width. Caches/TLBs consume majority of the resources so should be tuned as required. The default parameters give you quite large caches. Note
that WB inputs are flopped only when ONLY\_CORE=0 i.e., when the CPU is synthesized with cache and MMU.

* The processor provides a Wishbone B3 bus. It is recommended that you use it in registered feedback cycle mode.
* Interrupts are level sensitive and are internally synced to clock.

## 3. Project Environment

The recommended project environment requires Docker to be installed at your site. Click [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for instructions on how to install Docker. The steps here assume that the user is a part of the `docker` group.

If your site has the latest EDA tools required (Verilator, GTKWave, GCC Cross Compiler) installed, and if you do not wish to use Docker, then you should not pass the `DOCKER=1` argument when invoking `make`, hence the argument is shown as optional in the examples below.  

### 3.1. Running TCs

To run all/a specific TC, do:

> `make [DOCKER=1] [TC=test_name]`

See `src/ts` for a list of test names. Not providing a testname will run all tests.

To remove existing object/simulation/synthesis files, do:

> `make [DOCKER=1] clean`

### 3.2. Adding TCs

* Create a folder `src/ts/<test_name>`

* Please note that these will be run on the sample TB SOC platform.
  
  * See `src/testbench/testbench.v` for more information.

* Tests will produce wave files in the `obj/src/ts/<test_name>/zap.vcd`.

* Add a C file (.c), an assembly file (.s) and a linker script (.ld).

* Create a `Config.cfg`. This is a Perl hash that must be edited to meet requirements. Note that the registers in the `REG_CHECK` are indexed registers. To find those, please do:
  
  > `cat src/rtl/zap_localparams.svh | grep PHY`
  
  For example, if a check requires a certain value of R13 in IRQ mode, the hash will mention the register number as r25.

* Here is a sample `Config.cfg`:

```
       %Config = ( 
               # CPU configuration. Currently, testbench only supports LE.
               DATA_CACHE_SIZE             => 4096,    
               CODE_CACHE_SIZE             => 4096,    
               CODE_SECTION_TLB_ENTRIES    => 8,

               DATA_SECTION_TLB_ENTRIES    => 8,       
               DATA_SPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES      => 32,      
               DATA_LPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES      => 16,      
               BP_DEPTH                    => 1024,    
               INSTR_FIFO_DEPTH            => 4,       
               STORE_BUFFER_DEPTH          => 8,      

               # Debug helpers. 
               DEBUG_EN                    => 1,       
                                              # Enables debug print messages. 
                                              # Set DEBUG_EN=0 for synthesis.        

               # Testbench configuration.
               MAX_CLOCK_CYCLES            => 100000,  
                                              # Clock cycles to run the 
                                              # simulation for.

               REG_CHECK                   => {"r1" => "32'h4", 
                                               "r2" => "32'd3"},      
                                              # Make this an anonymous has with 
                                              # entries like "r10" => "32'h0". 

               FINAL_CHECK                 => {"32'h100" => "32'd4", 
                                               "32'h104" => "32'h12345678",
                                               "32'h66" =>  "32'h4"}   
                                              # Make this an anonymous hash
                                              # with entries like 
                                              # Base address of 32-bit word => 
                                              # 32-bit verilog_value. The 
                                              # script compares 4 bytes at 
                                              # once.
        );
```

### 3.3. Running RTL Lint

To run RTL lint, simply do:

> `make [DOCKER=1] lint`

### 3.4. Running Xilinx Vivado Synthesis

Synthesis scripts can be found here: `src/syn/`

Assuming you have Vivado installed, please do (in project root directory):

> `make syn`

Timing report will be available in `obj/syn/syn_timing.rpt`

#### 3.4.1. XDC Setup (Vivado FPGA Synthesis)

* The XDC assumes a 200MHz clock for an Artix 7 FPGA part with -3 speed grade.
* Input assume they receive data from a flop with Tcq = 50% of clock period.
* Outputs assume they are driving a flop with Tsu = 2ns Th=1ns.
* Setting FPGA synthesis clock to an unreasonably high FPGA design frequency may result in better timing closure (but will result in a larger FPGA design).
